# planner-using-react-redux-firebase
Create a planner with mario theme and deploy it in firebase hosting and use firestore for backend datastore

## Clone the project using git clone

## Install node
Download and install node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## open terminal on the project folder

## cd into marioplan folder
cd marioplan

## Install dependencies
"npm install'

## Note: currently "npm install firestore" isn't working :) use "npm install firestore --force" as alternative

## Install firebase-tools globally
"npm install -g firebase-tools"

## Initialize a firebase project in firebase page paste the confiurations to the /marioplan/src/config/fbConfigExample.js and rename the file to fbConfig.js

## "npm start" should start the project now!!

### Thanks
